# Intro
This is a windows shortcut that sleep the computer and turn the volume to mute mode. I would like to mute because it makes my life easier when opening the computer first time in public areas, in ease of avoiding annoying others while makeing myself awkward.

# notice
In order to use the quick short, you have to edit [fastSleep](./fastSleep)'s property by modifying the "-File" parameter to the full path of the [Ps1 file](./SleepAndSetVolumeToZero.ps1) on your computer.

# last
Hope things work well, I appreciate your like and any feedbacks are wellcome.
